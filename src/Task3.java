//    Task 3 - Until New java.time.Year’s Eve
//
//    Create a program that calculates the number of months and days until New Year’s Eve.
//    You can first create one LocalDate object representing today, and one java.time.LocalDate object that
//    represents the examination day.
//
//    Then use the Period class to get a Period between the two dates.
//
//    Print out the number of months and days of the Period object.
//
//    Also try to print out the total number of days until the examination day. Is this possible with
//    Period?
//
//    Try using the class ChronoUnit for this, like:
//    ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(today, newYearsEve);
